The following context and prompt can be used to extract all styling from react-based components so it can be used in vanilla HTML

- Context: https://uithub.com/marieooq/neo-brutalism-ui-library

- Prompt: does this codebase contain all info for remaking this in vanilla HTML that uses cdn.tailwindcss.com? If so, give me a HTML that implements the button with all its features
